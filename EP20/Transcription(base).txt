0.000000	5.920000	 Hey everyone, welcome to another episode and this week we will be covering our AWS
5.920000	12.000000	 ENS certification syllabus walkthrough. Now, I really wanted to bring some security
12.000000	18.320000	 news to you guys around cloud security, but well, to be honest, it was one of those weeks where
18.320000	23.840000	 I wasn't able to find any content worth sharing. Of course, there are a lot of security incidents
23.840000	29.440000	 around different parts of infrastructure, but anything covering cloud or cloud security,
29.440000	35.680000	 I was not able to find. So I thought maybe today's episode will be just wrapping up our AWS
35.680000	41.120000	 ENS certification syllabus walkthrough. One more thing which I did last week was to book my
41.120000	47.680000	 certification exam as well. I booked it for me first week. Now, if you want to continue this journey
47.680000	54.320000	 along with me now, then it's worth booking for yourself as well. I mean, for me, it was 50%
54.320000	61.680000	 of because I was already AWS certified in security specialty last year. If you have done similar
61.680000	67.360000	 certification from AWS, then it will be 50% discounted price for you as well. So it costed me
67.360000	74.880000	 around 150 USDs and you can easily calculate how much it will cost in your local currency as well.
74.880000	79.600000	 But anyhow, I have booked the examinations. So sort of it will give me a target date now,
79.600000	86.640000	 which is me first week before which we have to wrap up all the course content. That's why I thought
86.640000	92.000000	 even if we don't have any like cloud security news what's sharing this week, maybe I should come
92.000000	98.800000	 again before my regular by weekly episode. So I'm coming back this Sunday as well to record with you
98.800000	106.960000	 guys the AWS labours walkthrough of ENS certification. So this will help us in in kickstarting our content
106.960000	112.800000	 of the certification course and one of the topic which I feel which should be really good to start with
112.800000	119.360000	 will be VPC basics. So if you want to check out like VPC basics, then of course don't forget to
119.360000	125.200000	 listen to the next episode. But of course this episode is also worth listening as well because I am
125.200000	131.280000	 covering all the domain wise pending topics for domain two, three and four domain one. We have
131.280000	136.880000	 covered last week as well. So I won't be covering that again, but I thought maybe I will just give you
136.880000	142.320000	 at least the task statements as in just the title of domain one as well just to revise you guys. So after
142.320000	148.240000	 the short break, I will be covering domain one task statements, just titles and then we'll be going
148.240000	155.120000	 through domain two, three and four. All right, welcome back. So we will be starting our labours walkthrough
155.120000	163.280000	 of AWS ENS certification and like I mentioned, I will be covering domain one titles only. So domain
163.280000	171.360000	 one was network design and it covers up to 30% of the examination questions. What it will test us,
171.360000	178.400000	 it will test us around edge network services for global performance, DNS design across environments,
178.400000	184.480000	 load balancing for high availability, logging and monitoring across networks, routing and hybrid
184.480000	191.840000	 connectivity and multi account multi vision networking. So these six task statement will be covered as
191.840000	196.800000	 part of domain one. I covered the details of each task statement in last week episodes. So if you
196.800000	202.480000	 haven't checked that out yet, then of course it's worth checking that as well. Now let's continue with
202.480000	211.280000	 domain two. Now domain two is network implementation. So in this, the focus is on hands-on building and
211.280000	218.640000	 configuring real world network solutions on AWS. This domain makes up roughly 26% of the exam
218.640000	225.520000	 and it tests not just theory, but you can understand from the domain name itself. It also tests our
225.520000	231.440000	 practical implementation skills, which we will be using in the field. So it's not only about the
231.440000	237.600000	 concepts. We have to really know how to implement those concepts in the production or even develop
237.600000	242.560000	 an environment. I mean, because this is an examination. So of course, you are not expected to really work
242.560000	247.760000	 in production environment. So even if we are able to perform some of the task statements in the lab,
247.760000	253.520000	 if we are able to like test few scenarios, then it's worth mentioning here. Now first up,
253.520000	260.320000	 the task is 2.1, which is hybrid routing and connectivity. In this task, we will be implementing
260.320000	266.880000	 routing and connectivity between on-premise network and AWS cloud. I think I covered it in one of
266.880000	272.400000	 the topic of task statement one as well. But as the name implement, this is more towards not the
272.400000	278.240000	 concept, but practical side of things. So they want us to understand and implement more on how we can
278.240000	284.160000	 establish routing and connectivity between on-premises networks and AWS cloud. Now what we need to know
284.160000	290.080000	 here is how to choose and configure different protocols like if you want to use static and dynamic
290.080000	295.840000	 routing, because what we want to ensure is traffic flows correctly between environments. I mentioned
295.840000	302.160000	 last time as well, a multi-cloud multi-region scenario is kind of give us the best of all the worlds.
302.160000	307.200000	 And there is no point of setting up multi-region multi-cloud if you don't and show that there is
307.200000	312.880000	 connectivity across those two different locations or those two different types of infrastructure as well.
312.880000	318.800000	 Now in this, we will also work with VPNs, which are virtual private networks across the two sites.
318.800000	324.800000	 And it also includes physical connection. AWS does provide a physical connectivity option as well
324.800000	329.840000	 using AWS direct connect or you can have some VPNs which are running on the internet,
329.840000	335.760000	 so site to site VPNs. We have to understand networking fundamentals like layer two, layer three constructs
335.760000	342.560000	 such as VLANs IP addressing gateway switching and routing. Now, VLANs are not necessarily a concept
342.560000	347.520000	 onto the cloud, but we should be having some level of understanding because if you are connecting your
347.520000	352.640000	 cloud infrastructure to on-prem, then on-prem actually deals with VLANs, layer two switching,
352.640000	356.800000	 bridging and everything. So we have to understand from on-prem perspective as well.
356.800000	363.200000	 I'm not sure this topic will be going in detail on the on-prem networking side of concepts,
363.200000	368.000000	 but it's worth understanding them as well because if they are mentioning it in the exam,
368.000000	372.720000	 so maybe it will come like a scenario where you have to understand a bit of everything.
372.720000	379.360000	 Now this topic also tests our ability to integrate traffic management tools like transit gateways,
379.360000	386.240000	 specially for SDVAN type of solution or scenarios, configure DNS resolution across the environment,
386.240000	392.000000	 we can also set up load balancing solutions and we have to validate our setup by testing connectivity
392.000000	397.120000	 with tools like route analyzer and reachability analyzer. Monitoring and logging is of course part
397.120000	403.440000	 of feature as well, so we have to ensure that we can observe what traffic is flowing from in and out.
403.440000	408.480000	 It will not only help us in troubleshooting if there is some sort of connectivity loss or if you
408.480000	414.480000	 want to create a sort of like a high availability sort of networking, but it will also help us
414.480000	419.760000	 from the security perspective as well. If there is a malicious traffic flowing onto a network,
419.760000	425.920000	 we should be able to inspect the traffic and monitor the logs for any sort of abnormality.
425.920000	434.080000	 So this is our statement 2.1. In 2.2, we will be having again multi-account and multi-region connectivity,
434.080000	440.480000	 which is about expanding the connectivity across multiple AWS accounts, reasons and VPCs.
440.480000	446.320000	 Now in real enterprise environment, this is quite often that we have to span our network across
446.320000	451.840000	 the accounts or reason and of course AWS provide a lot of different patterns, solutions and services
451.840000	457.280000	 to implement that. For example, we can choose VPC peering, we can rely on transit gateway as a central
457.280000	463.920000	 hub for multi-VPC communication, we can implement VPNs as well and of course Cloudwind, which is a big
463.920000	471.360000	 multi-transit gateways across the reason managed by AWS solution. It's kind of like the biggest
471.360000	476.880000	 elephant which can control everything like what's going in and out into your network. We can also
476.880000	483.920000	 use AWS mechanisms for sharing the resources using resource access manager to share network resources
483.920000	489.760000	 across the accounts. So this task will test our ability to configure hub spoke architecture,
489.760000	496.880000	 managing intervpc routing and show service connectivity and it will include how DNS resolution
496.880000	502.240000	 works across the hybrid mesh. So it's not only the DNS resolution between two sides.
502.240000	508.160000	 Now it's part of like this hybrid mesh infrastructure. And again, security plays a role here too
508.160000	513.600000	 because we don't want to miss security at any course. So we'll be covering concepts like security
513.600000	519.120000	 groups, knuckles, firewalls, which help us protect boundaries between network segments.
519.120000	525.600000	 Now task statement 2.3 is around advanced DNS architecture. In this task, we will be tackling
525.600000	531.600000	 complex hybrid and multi-account DNS setups. So we must know when to use a public and private
531.600000	539.440000	 hosted zones because AWS provides both kind of DNSs. One of the DNS when we tag it as public zone
539.440000	545.360000	 will be then having accessibility or reachability from the public network while we can also set up
545.360000	551.840000	 a private zone root 53, which will be only used by VPCs which are in your private network. So those
551.840000	556.400000	 won't be reachable from outside network. And again, it depends on your use case. So if your application
556.400000	561.360000	 is not public facing like you don't want your application to reach from outside the network.
561.360000	565.520000	 Of course, there is no point of using this, right? So that's why we have like these different
565.520000	570.720000	 type of public and private hosted zones. We have to know how and when to implement conditional
570.720000	577.680000	 forwarding, how and when to configure aliases, e-recodes, TXT records, pointer records to support
577.680000	584.080000	 hybrid application. We also have to do with DNS delegation for adip security and how to share
584.080000	591.600000	 DNS services between the accounts using RAM. The big part of this skill set is practical implementation
591.600000	596.800000	 because configuring DNS zones and adjusting the traffic policies based on latency and
596.800000	602.560000	 osuography and monitoring the DNS behavior. Everything is really important not only from
602.560000	609.120000	 scalability of your network, but also from the perspective of security. So we have to cover some
609.120000	613.600000	 of the pillars here. We have to make sure operational excellence. So we have to make sure that
613.600000	620.320000	 operationally our DNSs are always in there for for application to use. We also have to make
620.320000	625.760000	 sure they are scalable. We have to make sure that they are secure as well. So all the well-architected
625.760000	631.680000	 framework, which we have discussed multiple times in our previously discussion. We had for AWS
631.680000	636.640000	 security specialty. You can go and check out those episodes as well. I covered well-architected
636.640000	642.880000	 framework pretty well before we unfortunately have to switch off our AWS security specialty
642.880000	648.400000	 examination because adbless doesn't like it that I am sharing the knowledge with you guys
648.400000	653.120000	 free of course. So maybe they have discontinued because they listen to my podcast as well.
653.120000	658.000000	 I'm not sure. But yes, you can check those episodes to understand well-architected framework.
658.000000	664.080000	 Now in task statement 2.4, we will be covering automate and configure network infrastructure,
664.080000	669.760000	 which moves into network automation and infrastructure configuration. Now networking automation
669.760000	675.680000	 and infrastructure configuration. I think those automation are really scary words if someone who is
675.680000	679.920000	 just now starting onto the cloud trying to understand the networking concept suddenly have to do
679.920000	685.280000	 with automation as well is like, wait, I don't even know how to do it manually man. Why you are teaching
685.280000	692.000000	 me how to automate this stuff? First, I have to know how to how I can do it with my own hands in manual
692.000000	698.880000	 and older way. But again, because this certification actually really target that concept, we have to
698.880000	704.320000	 understand it. And I'm sure because it's about AWS only. So they might be using just cloud
704.320000	710.880000	 formation and other IAC tools, not terraforms show because terraform is kind of like a multi vendor
710.880000	715.840000	 which is not AWS specific. So they won't be covering terraform in this certification exam.
715.840000	721.200000	 But let's check out in the details. So they do want us to use infrastructure as code. And yes,
721.200000	728.960000	 they are covering tools like AWS cloud formation, AWS cloud development kits, CDK, CLIs or SDKs to
728.960000	736.000000	 consistently provision and manage our networking resources. Now, I to be honest is really in favor of
736.000000	743.600000	 it because I am working in similar sort of setup. I have worked in past as well where scalability is
743.600000	750.800000	 really really big concern if you are using manual ways of deployment. So if you really want your
750.800000	756.080000	 your infrastructure to scale. So it's not about only about like saving your time in terms of initial
756.080000	761.360000	 configuration. If you want to continuously add more resources into your infrastructure, then of
761.360000	767.040000	 course automation and in freezer code helps a lot. So it's good that they are covering this aspect
767.040000	774.720000	 as part of the domain wise test as well. Now beyond these static templates of configure infrastructure,
774.720000	781.440000	 AWS is also expecting us to understand event driven automation. So how to how to eliminate risky
781.440000	787.280000	 hard coded values in templates, how to reduce human error through repeatable automated workflows,
787.280000	792.880000	 and what they want us to achieve. They want us to make sure that we are creating a efficient
792.880000	798.880000	 local network deployments that we can safely scale to higher limits. Now, in summary, I feel that
798.880000	806.400000	 domain two will really push our domain once knowledge from planning to actual implementation.
806.400000	812.640000	 And everything from hybrid cloud and multi VPC connectivity to advance DNS automated provisioning,
812.640000	819.360000	 it will really demonstrate like our real world capability to not just design, but actually build
819.360000	825.280000	 and maintain the sophisticated AWS network architecture. I hope you guys are clear with domain one
825.280000	830.800000	 and domain two. If you guys have any questions around that, then of course let me know in the comments
830.800000	837.520000	 and then I'll be try to find more information onto that. Maybe something bits sometime I miss myself.
837.520000	841.920000	 So if you feel like something is missing or something need to be explained in better way,
841.920000	847.360000	 then just let me know and I'll try to grab more resources around that. But anyways, let's switch to
847.360000	852.880000	 domain three now, which is network management and operation. Now you see the trajectory here.
852.880000	860.480000	 They wanted us to plan first or design first in domain one. They wanted us to implement in domain two.
860.800000	866.400000	 Like how we can do this stuff hands on and around end of domain two, they mentioned a bit
866.400000	873.040000	 about automation. Domain three is now building more into domain two, which is around management and
873.040000	878.880000	 orchestration as well as operation. So this is why I like the content of this compared to AWS
878.880000	885.600000	 security specialty because each domain, its task statement is nicely fitting one on top of another.
885.600000	891.200000	 So it's not like domain two have some topics, which are prerequisite or which gave you a building
891.200000	897.920000	 block of domain one or domain two. So as part of domain three, what we want is we want to make sure that
897.920000	905.840000	 our networking is healthy, available and efficient. So this domain accounts for 20% of the exam. And
905.840000	911.600000	 again, focus is on practical skills. We will be using daily once your network is designed and
911.600000	918.000000	 deployed. So domain one, designing domain two deployment domain three patients, so in task statement
918.000000	924.640000	 three dot one manage routing and connectivity in real world environments when we have like static
924.640000	931.120000	 networks, they easily evolve scale and connect with on premise environment again, multi cloud,
931.120000	936.080000	 multi regions. I keep on saying this statement again and again, in task statement three dot one,
936.080000	943.440000	 we will be expected to know how to maintain routing and connectivity across AWS hybrid networks.
943.440000	949.760000	 This mean you will need to be familiar with routing protocols and like in the context of AWS
949.760000	955.200000	 direct connect, we might have to understand more about VGP or VPNs, how different AWS components such
955.200000	962.320000	 as transit gateways direct connect gateways, virtual interfaces help link our environment. We also need to
962.320000	969.040000	 understand how routing limits and quotas might impact this sign decisions. I mean, I recall
969.040000	975.520000	 in one of the deployment lately, we were right in the end of our code like we have written everything
975.520000	981.840000	 for the new new deployment in one of the region only to realize that cloud man, which we use heavily
981.840000	988.880000	 is not supported in that region. So we have to end up like scratching everything right up everything
988.880000	995.120000	 from the perspective of another region. The limitations are around the regions where your particular
995.120000	1001.840000	 service is supported or not or quotas. They really impact design decisions and even troubleshooting
1001.840000	1008.080000	 the static and dynamic routing issues. Everything comes in a play maintaining private access path is
1008.080000	1013.440000	 really important as well. So reachability and I mentioned before as well. We can use VPC reachability
1013.440000	1020.320000	 analyzer, so we can use this quite heavily to check the connectivity and routing between the
1020.320000	1026.720000	 different locations. Now ensure this task will test our ability to ensure that data keeps flowing
1026.720000	1032.400000	 where it needs to go. So from point A to point B data should be reaching the package should reach
1032.400000	1037.680000	 from one location or source from destination. That's the whole point of setting the networking right.
1037.680000	1043.920000	 In task statement 3 or 2 we will be monitoring and analyzing network traffic. Now once our network
1043.920000	1049.920000	 is running the biggest challenges visibility and observability knowing what's happening between
1049.920000	1055.360000	 your interfaces or different parts. This task revolves around monitoring and analyzing network
1055.360000	1062.960000	 graphics. So our tools provided by AWS they can really help in this concept. So we have to be familiar
1062.960000	1069.360000	 with all those tools, which AWS provide like Amazon CloudWatch, VPC flow looks, traffic mirroring.
1069.360000	1074.080000	 They will help us to understand the connectivity patterns. They will help us in sporting the
1074.080000	1080.320000	 anomalies and of course we can easily identify and fix any sort of performance bottlenecks. We also
1080.320000	1086.960000	 have to use tools like reachability analyzer, transit network gateway manager to visually map topology
1086.960000	1092.240000	 and validate that our routing and configurations meet the intent result. The troubleshooting is
1092.240000	1099.280000	 cold part of this. So we have to understand all those concepts around packet sizing, expected latency
1099.280000	1105.440000	 if these are routing loop because this task measures how well we can detect the issues and we have
1105.440000	1112.320000	 to use AWS tools to diagnose them. Task statement 3 dot T covers optimizing networks for performance
1112.320000	1118.160000	 reliability and cost. This task statement pushes us into optimization because operational excellence
1118.160000	1123.840000	 isn't just about fixing your problem. We have to also make sure that we continuously improve the
1123.840000	1129.120000	 network performance, resilience and cost up essentially. So we have to understand when to use
1129.120000	1135.840000	 VPC peering versus transit gateways because sometimes the scenario might require us to use a different
1135.840000	1141.200000	 solution even though we have like multiple solution which can solve the same problem. We have to
1141.200000	1147.120000	 understand when to reduce bandwidth usage by using some sort of like efficient traffic patterns and
1147.120000	1152.720000	 we also have to understand about different sort of network interfaces as well because AWS does
1152.720000	1158.800000	 provide again lot of services. We have to know about those services as well. Configuration choices
1158.800000	1165.120000	 also will be covering route 53 DNS load balancing, subnet sizing, everything is covered as part
1165.120000	1170.640000	 of this optimization concept because optimization ties back into monitoring. The better we understand
1170.640000	1176.480000	 about traffic patterns, performance metrics, the more intelligently we can refine our architecture to
1176.480000	1183.920000	 meet SLA's and control AWS expenses. So in summary, domain 3 is where design which we have built
1183.920000	1190.080000	 as part of domain 2 meets our operations. We test our ability to maintain connectivity,
1190.080000	1196.560000	 see into networks behavior using AWS tools and make informed decisions that boost performance
1196.560000	1202.640000	 and reduce costs. Master these skills and you will not only is this part of certification but also
1202.640000	1209.840000	 become deeply effective at the real world cloud network operations. So domain 3 is really interesting
1209.840000	1216.960000	 because now we are covering operations part of what we have built as part of domain 2 and what you
1216.960000	1224.480000	 have designed as part of domain 1. Now domain 4 is none other than security and governance because
1224.480000	1230.400000	 how we can miss security and governance when we are recording a podcast in cloud security because
1230.400000	1235.600000	 we don't want to end up doing a certification with doesn't hover around security at all. Security
1235.600000	1241.760000	 is a key theme of our podcast and of course I want to cover a certification which also cover those
1241.760000	1248.320000	 aspects as well. Now in domain 4, we will be exploring network security compliance and governance.
1248.320000	1256.160000	 So in this section of AWS ANS we have to understand how we can protect monitor audit and go on the
1256.160000	1261.440000	 networks on AWS and in hybrid environment. So we cannot leave our on-prem environment behind
1261.440000	1267.440000	 we have to make sure that we are covered from everywhere because I mentioned in one of the scenarios
1267.440000	1274.320000	 in last week episode where one of the site was saved but because you have east to west connectivity
1274.320000	1279.360000	 between different sites maybe your second site is not as secure as your first one and then it will
1279.360000	1285.280000	 lead to all sorts of attacks on the second site. So we have to understand that in hybrid environment
1285.280000	1293.120000	 all the plugs all the gates are covered. Now in this domain it makes up around 24% of the exam
1293.120000	1297.760000	 and we will be covering security fundamentals, cell world controls and compliance visibility.
1297.760000	1304.480000	 Our statement 4.1 covers implementing and maintaining network security feature. So in this we have to
1304.480000	1309.600000	 meet our networking with security and compliance requirements. So this section will test both
1309.600000	1315.040000	 our theoretical understanding and practical skills in designing secure network infrastructure
1315.040000	1320.640000	 and the reason I can tell you why because we have to identify the threat models based on
1320.640000	1327.520000	 applications architecture. So think in terms of what can go wrong or from where potentially your
1327.520000	1332.880000	 attackers can try to get into your environment. So if you are working as a network architect
1332.880000	1337.840000	 doesn't mean that you don't care about how your application is using that network because ultimately
1337.840000	1343.440000	 network is there to serve an application right. So we have to recognize common security threats
1343.440000	1351.040000	 and how they can manifest and change or affect our network traffic. From there AWS does expect us
1351.040000	1355.920000	 to apply the controls to protect the network traffic flow as well. So this will include we have to
1355.920000	1362.960000	 secure inbound traffic using AWS WAF, AWS Shield or maybe AWS network firewall as well. So this will
1362.960000	1368.720000	 help us in protecting the apps which are apps post to the internet. We also have to make sure our
1368.720000	1374.560000	 outbound traffic is secure as well because I have seen a lot that people don't usually care about
1374.560000	1380.240000	 the outbound traffic. All they care about it what's coming inside the network from outside but they
1380.240000	1384.640000	 don't care like what's leaving from your network to outside because anything which leaves from your
1384.640000	1390.480000	 network to outside may cover some sensitive information as well. So we have to apply all sort of
1390.480000	1396.320000	 firewalls, proxies, gateway load balancer to filter and inspect egress connections as well.
1396.320000	1401.680000	 Layer level internal traffic segmentation and restriction with security groups, knuckles and
1401.680000	1408.400000	 VPC endpoint policies can give another layer of defense in depth. We also need to design architecture
1408.400000	1414.800000	 that meets compliance needs like we have to create isolated untrusted network, create parameter VPCs
1414.800000	1420.880000	 or separating workloads using three time model and build incident detection and alerting into the
1420.880000	1427.920000	 environment. Task statement 422 is around validate and audit security using monitoring and logging.
1427.920000	1432.720000	 So once our protections are in place, the next challenge is verification and auditing
1432.720000	1439.120000	 that's where this task comes in. So we will here look into various AWS visibility services like
1439.120000	1445.120000	 CloudWatch, Outrail, Prologues, Traffic Mirroring because all these tools help us in
1445.120000	1452.480000	 extending our observability arms so we can check alarms and metrics, we can track API activities,
1452.480000	1458.320000	 we can even have network traffic visibility. We also need to understand that network creates a lot
1458.320000	1465.280000	 of logs. So how we can deliver these logs reliably to maybe a centralized location or maybe our scene
1465.280000	1471.120000	 using kinesis, firehose or CloudWatch logs, how we can analyze them to spot anomalies and
1471.120000	1477.040000	 compliance violations, we may need to set up automated alarms and custom metrics as well,
1477.040000	1482.560000	 how we can correlate data from multiple sources, network configurations at scales using
1482.560000	1489.680000	 AWS trusted advisors, your degree reviews, etc. This task statement 422 is more about auditing what
1489.680000	1495.680000	 you have built so far. In task statement 423 which also happened to be our last task statement for
1495.680000	1502.320000	 this course is protecting confidentiality of data and communication. So in this we will be covering
1502.320000	1508.560000	 on confidentiality which covers encrypting data and protecting communication both in transit and
1508.560000	1514.480000	 across hybrid links. So key areas are like you have to increase the right network encryption as well
1514.480000	1519.600000	 because it's not about securing your data when it's on rest, we have to also secure the data when
1519.600000	1526.480000	 it's in transit. So for example, we can use IPsec for VPNs, we can use TLS for app traffic or maybe
1526.480000	1532.720000	 for your S3 buckets as well, understanding the AWS shared responsibility model and how in flight
1532.720000	1538.720000	 encryption fits all into this. We also have to make sure that our DNS communication is secure so
1538.720000	1545.520000	 we can use DNSsec which help in protecting domain name resolution. Of course AWS does provide some
1546.160000	1552.640000	 certificates as well. So services like AWS certification manager or private CA can help in
1552.640000	1558.800000	 generating the certificates and keys without exposing the sensitive material. So in domain 4,
1558.800000	1563.840000	 we will be covering network security front and center from designing secure traffic flows,
1563.840000	1570.080000	 capturing the telemetry and cryptic communication from the point of view of a security architect
1570.080000	1576.400000	 because it's not about only mastering the network architect but we have to also make sure that it's
1576.400000	1582.160000	 secure, compliant and auditable. Now from the main one to domain 4, it's all nicely stacked.
1582.160000	1586.640000	 First we designed the infrastructure, then we built. Once it's built, we have to make sure that our
1586.640000	1592.720000	 day one and day two configuration monitoring and alarm and all the practices around operations
1592.720000	1597.360000	 is covered. And last but not least, we have to make sure that everything we have built so far,
1597.360000	1602.080000	 not only is operationally excellent but also secure as well. So we have to make sure
1602.080000	1608.400000	 that all of our security configurations or security tools are monitoring our traffic and they are
1608.400000	1613.440000	 generating right blocks. Those logs can be analyzed anytime. And we also have to make sure that we are
1613.440000	1618.960000	 creating a network design which is not only secure but auditable as well. So it's covering all the
1618.960000	1625.440000	 compliance. So if you are hosting maybe PCI applications onto your cloud infra and what sort of
1625.440000	1630.560000	 additional security tools you should be having or using what sort of design recommendations you
1630.560000	1636.880000	 should have in your network side as well. Because although your data is stored in applications
1636.880000	1642.880000	 or in astray buckets maybe but they are still flowing on a backbone network and you as a cloud
1642.880000	1649.120000	 network architect is responsible for making sure that the network infra you have designed or
1649.120000	1654.880000	 network connectivity you have put in place is also compliant with whatever regulations you are
1654.880000	1661.600000	 following as in your organization. So I think these domain 1 to domain 4 they are pretty much like
1661.600000	1668.560000	 covering everything. They also are almost equals. So you can see post one was 30% but then
1668.560000	1675.040000	 VTG is like 26, 24, 25. So it's not like you can maybe take one of them lightly. You have to make
1675.040000	1681.920000	 sure that all of the domains are covered. All the task statements are covered as part of preparation
1681.920000	1686.640000	 for this exam. So that's why I said that because first topic is around building the infrastructure
1686.640000	1692.240000	 you have first have to know the basic building blocks which is VPCs maybe route 53 another thing which
1692.240000	1698.240000	 I can think of is different sort of load balancers maybe we can cover them. So they will be like
1698.240000	1703.600000	 could kick start to our certification journey because once we know what sort of basics
1703.600000	1710.240000	 AWS have in terms of AWS networking infrastructure then we can start building putting all other
1710.240000	1714.880000	 building blocks on top of them. So once that baseline is created we can start creating our building
1714.880000	1720.960000	 on top of that and then we can go deeper into which other services and which other tools we have to
1720.960000	1727.520000	 use as part of AWS networking and how we can make sure that it's secure as well how we can make sure
1727.520000	1734.080000	 that it's scalable as well because I was discussing to one of the one of my teammates one day and we were
1734.080000	1740.240000	 having this sort of like animated discussions around security versus productivity so we don't want to
1740.240000	1746.400000	 end up securing everything but in turn losing the productivity of the organization also we don't want
1746.400000	1753.040000	 to be highly productive but then it's open to everyone to attack us. So both of these need to be
1753.040000	1761.280000	 in place and that's why I feel that this certification fits perfectly into our cloud security
1761.280000	1768.800000	 journey because it will help us in understanding how we can make sure that all the gates like I said
1768.800000	1775.200000	 are closed or covered or monitored because ultimately people are coming from some ingress and
1775.200000	1780.800000	 ingress point and by people I mean the attackers they are coming from some ingress and ingress points
1780.800000	1786.960000	 if you know where those points are if you know how those points are open what sort of monitoring is
1786.960000	1793.120000	 placed don't know those points then I think half the battle is won. So yeah I think this is really good
1793.120000	1799.200000	 start to our certification journey. In next week episode I will be covering these basics which I
1799.200000	1806.800000	 mentioned also I have some incredible idea around one of the topic which is like coming in my mind
1806.800000	1815.440000	 for quite a while now which is discussing about AI versus anti AI now I'm not anti AI at all I love
1815.440000	1821.680000	 using AI tools means they help us in not only improving my productivity but also delivering this
1821.680000	1827.360000	 podcast as well I'm using sort of automation and AI tools to make sure that I'm delivering
1827.360000	1833.520000	 nice hot content to you guys every week so that's why it's getting more normal now because I'm
1833.520000	1839.680000	 using these AI tools to build build and deliver to you guys but then again there are people who don't
1839.680000	1846.160000	 like AI because yeah some people are still quite reluctant to use AI tools because it's not something
1846.160000	1851.200000	 they are either familiar with or they are really they feel like this is something which is
1851.200000	1858.800000	 not not quite of ethical you know because people will feel like or it's it's actually heavily
1858.800000	1864.560000	 discussed in the industry as well that if you're using AI tools then you're less using your thinking
1864.560000	1869.920000	 and your own thought process you're less using your own brain to find up with unique ideas and
1869.920000	1877.200000	 solutions and then you end up in completely relying on these AI tools which you're using in your
1877.200000	1884.400000	 like improving the productivity so yeah I am writing something around AI versus anti AI and that
1884.400000	1890.160000	 I'll be covering in next week episode so kind of like like just a normal my thoughts on that topic
1890.160000	1896.480000	 and of course then I'll be covering in main episode AWS networking basics as well so those two
1896.480000	1902.240000	 exciting topics will be there as part of next week episode please continue listening because every
1902.240000	1908.880000	 week I'm trying my best to bring to you the better content than last week so I'm trying to improve
1908.880000	1915.200000	 every week and it will help a lot that if you share the word if you subscribe if you comment if it's
1915.200000	1920.400000	 something which is missing and I'll try to cover that I'll try to improve in that aspect as well
1920.400000	1926.160000	 so that's it for today's episode I hope you enjoyed it and let's catch up in the next week's episode
1926.160000	1928.986062	 goodbye and good luck
