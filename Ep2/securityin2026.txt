🎙️ Welcome back to CloudSec Insights! Today we’re peeking into what the future holds for cloud security — especially at the intersection of AI and modern cloud adoption. This is based on expert analysis from Dark Reading’s Melinda Marks.

☁️ Cloud Platforms and AI — A Perfect Storm for Innovation and Risk

First up — cloud service providers (like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud) are competing hard to be the go-to platforms for AI workloads. Nearly every organization surveyed is either already running AI in the cloud or planning to soon.

That means security is more important than ever — and we’re seeing a shift in expectations about who does what:

Cloud providers will embed more native security tools into their platforms.

But most teams will still use a mix of those built-in tools and third-party solutions.

The traditional shared responsibility model — where providers secure the platform and customers secure what goes on it — is still true, but teams really do see security as a joint effort.

So deeper collaboration between cloud vendors, security vendors, and internal teams is now a must, not optional.

🔐 What’s Next for Security Tools?

Melinda Marks write something which makes it more interesting — and a bit futuristic:

Expect CSPs to acquire security startups more often, building new protections directly into their clouds.

Third-party security vendors won’t disappear — but they’ll need to become more integrated and efficient. Lots of teams are tired of too-many disconnected security tools, so solutions that unify alerts, context, and response are becoming more valuable.

🤖 AI — The Double-Edged Sword

Now — the really big trend: agentic AI — software that can act autonomously to get things done.

Security teams are already experimenting with AI agents that can:

automate detection and response,

fix code issues,

even monitor apps continuously.

But — the flip side? Attackers are using AI too. Faster, more automated attacks are on the horizon. So defenders must also embrace AI to keep pace.

This changes the game:

AI could help security teams do jobs that were previously manual.

We might soon see AI agents actively hunting vulnerabilities or patching issues in real time.

The challenge will be trust — can we really let machines act autonomously without human oversight?

💥 Evolving Threats in the Cloud

Looking at the threat landscape — as cloud environments get more complex, attackers are doing the same:

We’ll likely see more software supply chain attacks targeting dependencies and build tools.

Attacks focused on weak access points — including non-human identities like service accounts or AI agents — are expected to rise.

And widespread AI use means attackers can scale their activities, probing for vulnerabilities faster than ever.

🤝 What This Means for Teams

As organizations chase productivity and innovation, there’s a human element too:

Security teams risk being left out of decisions made by other groups adopting cloud and AI tools.

That means security leaders must assert their role early — because a security incident isn’t just an IT problem anymore — it affects operations, uptime, and customer trust.

🎧 In short: 2026 is shaping up to be a year where cloud security and AI go hand-in-hand — for both defenders and attackers. Cloud providers will strengthen their security offerings; third-party vendors must unify and innovate; and teams will need to embrace AI smartly to keep up with rapidly evolving threats.
