# Benefits for AI

So, here’s the headline: Nationwide, the UK’s largest building society, has just deepened its partnership with AWS — Amazon Web Services — with a big focus on AI-driven cloud security and fraud prevention.

Picture this: a financial institution with millions of members, a sprawling branch network, and both face-to-face and online services. Now stack on top of that the modern cyber threat landscape — where fraud and impersonation scams aren’t just nuisances, they’re real and rising. According to Nationwide, impersonation scams accounted for almost one-fifth of all incidents they saw between 2024 and 2025.

To help tackle that, they’re extending their use of AWS’s cloud infrastructure and AI tools — especially in things like Amazon Connect, the contact centre platform that now powers a tool called Call Checker. This lets customers quickly and securely verify they’re really speaking to a legitimate Nationwide employee, which is a nice example of security enhancing trust, not getting in the way of it.

On the tech side, the more AWS and Nationwide collaborate, the quicker Nationwide can deploy new innovations, scale security systems, and adapt to evolving threats — all while keeping up with strict financial compliance standards. That’s not small talk; it’s essential for a bank that handles sensitive data every day.

What’s also cool about this expanded partnership is that it isn’t just about throwing technology at a problem. AWS is working with Nationwide to upskill its own teams, giving employees access to cloud and AI training — turning a tech stack into a smarter workforce, not just smarter machines.

In other words, this isn’t just a security upgrade — it’s a strategic transformation. It’s about making a traditional financial organisation more resilient, more responsive, and more customer-centric in an era where cyber threats and customer expectations both keep rising.

So when you hear headlines about big banks and AI, it’s not always hype. In this case, it’s real — and it’s an example of how cloud infrastructure can future-proof security and service at the same time.


# Against AI for cloud security

In our last segment we talked about how AWS is using AI to bolster cloud security for Nationwide. But not everyone thinks AI is a security super-weapon. In fact, some tech leaders are warning that AI could make attacks more sophisticated and dangerous instead of just improving defenses.

Take Chuck Robbins, the CEO of Cisco — the networking giant best known for routers, firewalls and enterprise infrastructure. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, he made a pretty stark point: AI doesn’t just empower defenders — it empowers attackers too. According to Robbins, AI will “make our cyber attacks better” and could make phishing scams and other malicious hacks appear way more convincing to everyday users. That’s not just a technical footnote — that’s a real threat to people and companies everywhere.

Let’s unpack that. Traditional phishing emails are already a thorn in every organisation’s side. But throw AI into the mix, and you suddenly have phishing that can:

mimic real people almost perfectly,

tailor messages to individuals using info scraped from social media,

and adapt language and tone in real-time to bypass suspicion.

That’s exactly the scenario Robbins warned about — where cybercriminals use AI to “make the scams that people see in their inboxes seem more real.” And that’s not speculation; other industry research shows that AI-related security incidents affected nearly nine out of ten organisations in the past year alone, with many struggling to defend against new, AI-powered attack patterns.

Another layer to this counter-argument is readiness. Cisco’s own studies show that while a huge majority of CEOs plan to adopt AI, only a tiny fraction actually feel prepared to manage the security risks that come with it. This means organisations may rush into AI without fully understanding or preparing for the expanded attack surface it creates — giving cybercriminals a huge advantage.

So the warning here isn’t “don’t use AI” — it’s more nuanced: AI changes the game in both offense and defense. If organisations treat AI only as a defensive tool, without building secure infrastructure, governance, training, and tight controls around how AI is used, they might actually end up less secure than before — not more.

In other words, AI’s role in cybersecurity isn’t a straightforward superhero story — it’s more like giving both sides a jetpack. You’ve still got to make sure your shield is stronger than their sword.
